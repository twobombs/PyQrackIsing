# PyQrack Ising
Efficiently generate near-ideal samples from transverse field Ising model (TFIM)

(It's "the **Ising** on top.")

## Installation
From PyPi:
```
pip3 install PyQrackIsing
```

From Source: install `pybind11`, then
```
pip3 install .
```
in the root source directory (with `setup.py`).

Windows users might find Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) to be the easier and preferred choice for installation.

## Usage

```py
from PyQrackIsing import generate_tfim_samples

samples = generate_tfim_samples(
    J=-1.0,
    h=2.0,
    z=4,
    theta=0.174532925199432957,
    t=5,
    n_qubits=56,
    shots=100
)
```

There are two more functions, `tfim_magnetization()` and `tfim_square_magnetization()`, that follow the same function signature except without the `shots` argument.

## About
Transverse field Ising model (TFIM) is the basis of most claimed algorithmic "quantum advantage," circa 2025, with the notable exception of Shor's integer factoring algorithm.

Sometimes a solution (or at least near-solution) to a monster of a differential equation hits us out of the blue. Then, it's easy to _validate_ the guess, if it's right. (We don't question it and just move on with our lives, from there.)
