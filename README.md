## Installation
From PyPi:
```
pip3 install PyQrackIsing
```

From Source: install `pybind11`, then
```
pip3 install .
```
in the root source directory (with `setup.py`).

Windows users might find Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) to be the easier and preferred choice for installation.

## Usage

```py
from PyQrackIsing import generate_tfim_samples

samples = generate_tfim_samples(
    J=-1.0,
    h=2.0,
    z=4,
    theta=0.174532925199432957,
    t=5,
    n_qubits=56,
    shots=100
)
```

There are two other functions, `tfim_magnetization()` and `tfim_square_magnetization()`, that follow the same function signature except without the `shots` argument.

The library also provides a TFIM-inspired (approximate) MAXCUT solver:
```py
from pyqrackising import maxcut_tfim
import networkx as nx

G = nx.petersen_graph()
best_solution_bit_string, best_cut_value, best_node_groups = maxcut_tfim(G, quality=8)
```

We also provide `maxcut_tfim_sparse(G)`, for `scipy` CSR sparse arrays (or `networkx` graphs). The (integer) `quality` setting is optional, with a default value of `8`, but you can turn it up for higher-quality results, or turn it down to save time. (You can also optionally specify the number of measurement `shots` as an argument, if you want specific fine-grained control over resource usage.) If you want to run MAXCUT on a graph with non-uniform edge weights, specify them as the `weight` attribute of each edge, with `networkx`. (If any `weight` attribute is not defined, the solver assumes it's `1.0` for that edge.)

Based on a combination of the TFIM-inspired MAXCUT solver and another technique for finding ground-state energy in quantum chemistry that we call the _"binary Clifford eigensolver,"_ we also provide an (approximate) spin glass ground-state solver:
```py
from pyqrackising import spin_glass_solver
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np


# NP-complete spin glass
def generate_spin_glass_graph(n_nodes=16, degree=3, seed=None):
    if not (seed is None):
        np.random.seed(seed)
    G = nx.random_regular_graph(d=degree, n=n_nodes, seed=seed)
    for u, v in G.edges():
        G[u][v]['weight'] = np.random.choice([-1, 1])  # spin glass couplings
    return G


G = generate_spin_glass_graph(n_nodes=64, seed=42)
solution_bit_string, cut_value, node_groups, energy = spin_glass_solver(G, quality=6, best_guess=None)
# solution_bit_string, cut_value, node_groups, energy = spin_glass_solver(G, best_guess=maxcut_tfim(G, quality=6)[0])
```
We also provide `spin_glass_solver_sparse(G)`, for `scipy` **upper-triangular** CSR sparse arrays (or `networkx` graphs). The (integer) default `quality` setting is `6`. `best_guess` gives the option to seed the algorithm with a best guess as to the maximal cut (as an integer, binary string, or list of booleans). By default, `spin_glass_solver()` uses `maxcut_tfim(G)` with passed-through `quality` as `best_guess`, which typically works well, but it could be seeded with higher `maxcut_tfim()` `quality` or Goemans-Williamson, for example. This function is designed with a sign convention for weights such that it can immediately be used as a MAXCUT solver itself: you might need to reverse the sign convention on your weights for spin glass graphs, but this is only convention.

From the `spin_glass_solver()`, we provide a (recursive) Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver:
```py
from pyqrackising import tsp_symmetric
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np

# Traveling Salesman Problem (normalized to longest segment)
def generate_tsp_graph(n_nodes=64, seed=None):
    if not (seed is None):
        np.random.seed(seed)
    G = nx.Graph()
    for u in range(n_nodes):
        for v in range(u + 1, n_nodes):
            G.add_edge(u, v, weight=np.random.random())
    return G


n_nodes = 128
G = generate_tsp_graph(n_nodes=n_nodes, seed=42)
circuit, path_length = tsp_symmetric(
    G,
    start_node=None,
    end_node=None,
    monte_carlo=True,
    quality=2,
    is_cyclic=True,
    multi_start=1,
    k_neighbors=20
)

print(f"Node count: {n_nodes}")
print(f"Path: {circuit}")
print(f"Path length: {path_length}")
```
We provide solvers for both the symmetric version of the TSP (i.e., the distance from "A" to "B" is considered the same as from "B" to "A") and asymmetric version (`tsp_asymmetric()`). `monte_carlo=True` switches out the MAXCUT-based heuristic for pure Monte Carlo recursive bipartitioning. `multi_start` controls how many stochastic repeats of MAXCUT are tried to select the best result, at every level of recursion. `k_neighbors` limits the count of nearest-neighbor connections considered for 3-opt.

If memory footprint of the graph or adjacency matrix is a concern, but the weights can be reconstructed by formula on demand, we offer `maxcut_tfim_streaming()` and `spin_glass_solver_streaming()`:
```py
from pyqrackising import spin_glass_solver_streaming
# from pyqrackising import maxcut_tfim_streaming
from numba import njit


# This is a contrived example.
# The function must use numba NJIT.
# (In practice, even if you use other Python functionality like itertools,
# you can pre-calculate and load the data as a list through the arguments tuple.)
@njit
def G_func(node_pair, args_tuple):
    i, j = min(node_pair), max(node_pair)
    return ((j + 1) % (i + 1)) / args_tuple[0]


n_qubits = 64
nodes = list(range(n_qubits))
args_tuple = (n_qubits,)

solution_bit_string, cut_value, node_groups, energy = spin_glass_solver_streaming(G_func, nodes, G_func_args_tuple=args_tuple, quality=6, best_guess=None)
# solution_bit_string, cut_value, node_groups = maxcut_tfim_streaming(G_func, nodes, G_func_args_tuple=args_tuple)
```

## About
Transverse field Ising model (TFIM) is the basis of most claimed algorithmic "quantum advantage," circa 2025, with the notable exception of Shor's integer factoring algorithm.

Sometimes a solution (or at least near-solution) to a monster of a differential equation hits us out of the blue. Then, it's easy to _validate_ the guess, if it's right. (We don't question it and just move on with our lives, from there.)

### Dual-Use Statement for PyQrackIsing

**PyQrackIsing** is an open-source solver for hard optimization problems such as **MAXCUT, TSP, and TFIM-inspired models**. These problems arise across logistics, drug discovery, chemistry, materials research, supply-chain resilience, and portfolio optimization. By design, PyQrackIsing provides **constructive value** to researchers and practitioners by making advanced optimization techniques accessible on consumer hardware.

Like many mathematical and computational tools, the algorithms in PyQrackIsing are _dual-use._ In principle, they can be applied to a wide class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. One such problem is integer factoring, which underlies RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). We emphasize:

- **We do not provide turnkey factoring implementations.**
- **We have no intent to weaponize this work** for cryptanalysis or "unauthorized access."
- **The constructive applications vastly outweigh the destructive ones** â€” and this project exists to serve those constructive purposes in the Commons.

It is already a matter of open record in the literature that factoring can be expressed as a QUBO. What PyQrackIsing demonstrates is that **QUBO heuristics can now be solved at meaningful scales on consumer hardware**. This underscores an urgent truth:

ðŸ‘‰ **RSA and ECC should no longer be considered secure. Transition to post-quantum cryptography is overdue.**

We trust that governments, standards bodies, and industry stakeholders are already aware of this, and will continue migration efforts to post-quantum standards.

Until then, PyQrackIsing remains a tool for science, logistics, and discovery â€” a gift to the Commons.
